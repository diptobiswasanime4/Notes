CIA Triad consists of 3 elements:

1. Confidentiality
2. Integrity
3. Availability
## Confidentiality

Confidentiality means that only the legitimate parties should be able to receive and understand information. Hence we should prevent unauthorized access and disclosure.

Example - I'm sending money to my Bank account. Only me and my Bank should be knowing the details, no one else should.
## Integrity

Integrity means whatever information is being sent by the sender, the receiver should receive exactly the same. In other words, there should not be any tampering with the message in between.

Example - I'm sending Rs. x to my Bank account. The Bank shouldn't receive the message as Rs. y, or being sent by another person.
## Availability

Availability is the timely and reliable access to a Computer System.

## Additional Elements

1. Authenticity - Computer System must be able to verify the identity of the sender.
2. Accountability - Computer System should be responsible and accountable by keeping track of activities, as a preventive measure against potential [[Threats and Attacks|threats]]
