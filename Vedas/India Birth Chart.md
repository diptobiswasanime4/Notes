- India is represented by Jupiter (knowledge) & Ketu (detachment)
- India is least represented by Rahu (mischief) & Venus (passion)
- However Modern India has Rahu Lagna

## Zodiac

- Taurus - very stable

## Lagna

Modern India is ruled by Rahu, the planet of mischief, very unlike India

Hence astrologers didn't want to pick this date, but given no other choice, they made the best out of the worst! The best example is Pakistan, something that we've avoided.

Rahu Mahadasha (2032-2050) will either turn India into a Superpower, or keep India a struggling country for the next 100 Years. We again have to make the best out of the worst.
