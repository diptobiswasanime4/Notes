There were 4 guards, one of them is Mitch, and Dane, all were walking through the forest. The guards had torches. They were escorting him outside. The forest didn't look as scary in the presence of few company.

"So Dane, I heard you and Shane grew up together, you were such good friends. So why did Shane all of a sudden kick you out? Looks odd to me", Mitch asked Dane.

"No idea", Dane sighed. "I have no idea Mitch, what wrong did I do? Do you have any idea?"

"Me?", Mitch laughed. "What a funny question? How do I know what's happening between the two of you?"

"Even I don't know. So I'm asking you. You may have some idea. Being in charge of the Military, you may have some hunch or intuition if nothing else."

"You're saying puny guards like us, the Military", Mitch laughed hard. The other guards were stoic. "You're funny man! I have no idea."

"Oh that's too bad."

"But if you talk about intuition. Checka's sister very good at this. I didn't know you were such good friends. You have a great talent of making good friends everywhere I must tell you."

"Thanks a lot. But she didn't say anything. She only gave me a blank piece of paper."

"She's actually very popular. A lot of puny people went to her to read their fortune. And whatever she says is mostly right. Lot of my friends in the guards also knows her. She reads fortune for minimal cost, and sometimes for free, but she's moody, she doesn't read often, and sometimes she gives a blank paper."

"That's what she did."

"Because she says she doesn't want to become popular, especially among the higher ups. She's happy being a peasant."

"I'd dispute that in the past. But now I agree", Dane said.

"I'd always agree. The higher ups are scum!", Mitch said.

"... ..."

"Don't worry man! You're no longer a higher up. You're now a peasant, so you're good", Mitch laughed.

Dane also laughed.

"But one thing I will tell you."

"... ..."

"It's not intelligence or intuition. It's only my opinion..."

"No worries. I'll take it with a pinch of salt."

"You stole the words out of my mouth."

"LOL"

Mitch became silent and serious. Dane was observing him.

Mitch started narrating about an old story about the Duke, that he witnessed along with Checka. He never thought it to be so serious but now he assumes it is. Dane started listening.

Mitch doesn't remember the exact time. But it's around 10 years ago. Everybody was much younger back then. Mitch and Checka went out for fishing at a stream within the Duke's territory. They used to hang out around the place often. Chen was also with them. But she was not into fishing. She got her Interactive Crystal from somewhere, and she used to practice talking with it, sometimes also read fortune, mostly out of fun.

When they were fishing. They found the Duke, some guards were escorting him. They were little bit surprised.

"Hey Mitch, I see somebody", Checka noticed somebody while fishing.

"Are you mad? Nobody knows about the place apart from us", Mitch was focused on catching a fish. He didn't care.

"I think it's the Duke. But why I wonder?"

"The Duke!"

"Take a look."

Both Mitch and Checka was very surprised looking at the Duke being escorted by some guards at such a remote place. They were also little bit scared.

"Shall we follow them", Checka asked.

"It'll be trouble if we get caught", Mitch said. He looked scared.

"You're right. But why is he here?"

"I don't know? it's his land, he could go anywhere!"

"You're right again. So what should we do?"

"Let's get out of here."

"... ..."

"Let's not get caught. Tomorrow he'll visit some other place. Then we can have fun."

"I don't disagree."

Both of them ran towards Chen, who was talking with the Crystal at some distance.

"Chen, we're leaving for today", Checka said.

"But why? We just came here", Chen was annoyed.

"The Duke is here. And it'll be trouble if we get caught. We're not supposed to leave the Village and Farms anyway."

"But that's why this place is for. It's a secret place!"

"It's not secret, when the Duke is here", Checka yelled.

"Be quiet. All of us will get caught like this", Mitch said.

"Ok ok no worries. Let me ask Crystal Cyan, why the Duke is at our Secret Place? Then everything will be sorted."

All of them looked at the Crystal. The Crystal showed Clouds, then the Castle appeared from the Clouds, the Duke's face appeared. They saw the Duke walking through Grass, Desert, Mountains, then they saw Gold, and Treasure, and lastly Blood! And a shadow of a person over the Blood.

They were all scared to look at this.

"What does this mean Chen", Mitch asked. "I don't feel good about this."

"It's not that bad also."

"What does it mean", both Checka and Mitch were curious.

"The Duke says his Great Grandfather was a great war hero. So he was granted this land by the king. That may not be true, mostly false. The Castle's origins are Cloudy", Chen said.

"So that's what the Castle coming out the Cloud says", Checka said.

"I always knew. The Castle is a shady place. The Duke loves money and gold and shiny, precious elements. He has done a lot of hard work, also bad work collecting them. He hides them somewhere. Could be somewhere around here."

"Here? Where", Mitch and Checka were very surprised, also scared. They also had little bit of greed.

"Come on guys. I can't say everything", Chen laughed.

"... ..."

"I don't know. May not be here. But surely somewhere nearby."

"... ..."

"But the Duke is very protective about his treasure. He'll go as far as killing people who has an eye on it."

"And so the Blood", says Mitch. "Scary."

"Not so scary again. Because someone may kill the Duke and get all his wealth."

"Who", Mitch said.

"We don't know who. It could be anybody", Chen said.

"Why do you think so? I think the Crystal meant that the Duke says 'there will be blood' if anybody comes near his treasure", Mitch asked.

"You're right. But the Duke may get killed also. And lose all his wealth."

"... ..."

"Maybe you guys didn't notice the shadow of a person over the Blood."

"... ..."

"There was."

Checha and Mitch looked at each other. They really didn't notice.

"But we shouldn't worry. We're peasants. These things are for the higher ups to deal with. We don't need that much Gold. What'll you even do, eat Gold", Chen laughed.

Then they left the place and left the Duke alone with his Gold.

Mitch concluded the story. Quite the Normie and boring story.

"Interesting story", Dane remarked. "But seems odd."

"Why so", Mitch asked.

"Because this is a story from 10 years ago. And none of this has really happened right."

"... ..."

"I mean have you tried searching, if the Duke is hiding Gold in that place or not."

"Not really!"

"Because you love your lives."

"Of course."

"But now it's 10 years. And the Duke died a natural death. Nobody killed him and took over his fortune."

"... ..."

"Shane inherited it. He'd be getting it anyway."

"... ..."

"Or are you suggesting?"

"No no. I'm not suggesting that. I agree, Shane would be getting it anyway."

"So it's a wrong prediction. That's why I never count on predictions. They can go wrong on so many parameters."

"Wait wait wait. It's a story from 10 years ago. I may not fully remember what Chen said. I'll once check with her."

"If she remembers."

"I think she meant, if somebody crosses the Duke there will be Blood, otherwise things will be normal, as it is, and chill."

"This is more likely."

"But we went to the place many more times. For fishing and playing of course. We also saw the Duke many more times. They hang out on the other side of the stream at a distance. So we could observe from a safe distance. But cannot eavesdrop or follow. Then I believe around few years ago or so we didn't see the Duke anymore, and even we stopped going there. We made many friends, like you for example, and we used to hang around other places. Like we have so much time, always following around the Duke", Mitch started laughing.

"So do you recall any other interesting stories?"

"Not really. Yeah but there was one time..."

"... ..."

"The Duke met with the king, the current king."

"The Duke brought the King, where he hides his treasure!?"

"Even I couldn't believe my eyes. That day even Checka and Chen was also not there. And they couldn't believe that the King was there when I told them."

"Even I cannot believe."

"That day. I gathered some courage and followed them."

"... ..."

"I couldn't believe what I saw. It felt like a nightmare..."

"You're clearly cooking stories up."

"Even I think so, when I recall. But I'm absolutely certain. Hear me out."

Mitch went on and told an old story of the King and the Duke. Dane heard attentively. Even he couldn't believe what he heard.

Mitch told him the story, when the story ended they had already reached the exit.

It was time for Goodbye! And Goodluck.
