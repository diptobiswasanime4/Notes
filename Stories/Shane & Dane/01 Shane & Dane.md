Dane left the Castle at midnight. He crossed the moat surrounding the Castle, and looked back. He was really disappointed and sad. He was really good friends with Shane, the Duke's son, at least he thought he was. Both of them had known each other since childhood. Rather he is only 2 years older than him, and acted like an elder brother. Now Shane is asking him to leave, already asked.

Shane has changed a lot since the Duke's death. Or maybe he was always like that. Only after the old man's death he's showing his true colors. Dane even requested him not to send him off at midnight, and wait for the next morning. But Shane was impatient. He wanted Dane out immediately! Who knows what wrong Dane has done, because he has no clue.

Dane was looking back at the Castle and reminiscing so many old memories about the old man and Shane. The Castle was almost like his family. But no more. He is sad. But not really shocked. He may have expected this sooner or later. Although he believed to have good relations with everybody in the Castle, including Shane, but people change, how they change is often not to our liking.

The Castle is surrounded by forest. There is a narrow path inside the forest that leads outside the territory of the Duke. The path is very dangerous at night-time. But Dane is not really worried. He feels sad and free at the same time. He has bigger things to worry about currently. He started walking following the narrow path. He hears growls of several animals inside the forest. Other people would be scared. But he finds it beautiful. He has an old relationship with the forest also.

Some subjects of the Duke also live nearby in smaller houses. Dane thought whether he should pay them a visit. And suddenly he met an old woman, standing in his way. He is not surprised, he knows her very well, she works under the Duke, currently Shane. With her came some other subjects of the Duke. They're all well-known faces. The old woman is the eldest of them all.

"Shane", the old lady said.

"Dane...", Dane corrected.

"Yes, Dane", the old lady corrected herself. "The two of you are so similar that I mis-spoke", she smiled.

"I know. This is not the first time this is happening", Dane smiled back.

"Yes, since childhood I find both of you to be very similar", the old lady laughed.

"... ...", Dane smiled.

"But maybe not anymore", the old lady looked down and sighed. "I was shocked to know that Shane has asked you to leave as soon as the Duke died. What happened to him? He wasn't like that before! Nor is there any Witch in the Castle he's possessed by", the old lady looked at Dane with teary eyes.

"I don't know. Even I was surprised. He didn't even allow me to stay till tomorrow morning. Maybe he was always like that", Dane said.

"Impossible!"

"... ..."

The old lady started crying. The people around her tried to console her. "He was very timid when he was a child. You were like an elder brother. And now this!"

"... ...", Dane didn't say a word.

"Dane, I'll say tonight you stay with us. It's very dangerous, going out right now. Even if you safely leave the Duke's territory, where will you go after that, have you decided anything? You take some rest now, and leave tomorrow morning", Checka said. Dane knows him very well. He's a friend.

"Even I want to do the same. But I don't know it's allowed or not", Dane said.

"What do you mean allowed or not", Checka asked with worry.

"Maybe you'll get in trouble if I stay with you. Shane asked me to leave right away, on my face!"

"... ...", Checka was silent.

"Dane is right. We'll get in trouble, if we allow Dane to stay", Chen said. She's Checka's sister. She's a mystic and fortune-teller. She moves everywhere with a shiny crystal.

"Is your Crystal saying something", Checka asked.

"No, my common sense is saying", Chen replied.

"My common sense is saying, we should help our friend in his difficult times", Checka asserted.

"Even I want to do that. But we shouldn't...", Chen said. She looked serious.

"Why!?", Checka asked with wonder.

"Shane... his intentions are shady. He's upto something."

"... ...", both Dane and Checka listened carefully.

"Let's stay out of his sight for now, is what my intuition says", Chen concluded.

Everybody seemed to agree. They all remained silent for a while. Then they heard the sound of some boots. It's the Castle guards.

"Checka, your sister is right", one of the guards said.

Everybody was scared. Some panicked. Chen was standing still. She looked cautious, but not scared.

"Dane shouldn't wait for long. Do you know why?"

Everybody was once again silent. They wanted to know why.

"Because Shane has sent us to kill him, if found within his territory!"

"... ...", everybody was speechless.

"But worry not. We'll not kill him. Because he's also our friend. Instead we'll see him off."

"... ...", everybody was once again speechless, but this time with relief.

"Hey Dane, it's me Mitch, it's been a while since we met. And thanks a lot for your help last time", one of the guards greeted Shane. "Even us, the guards were shocked to hear that you were banished. Not many of us know you very well, but those who do only has good things to share about you. And I convinced the rest of us, to drop this stupid order of killing you, we're 1-1 now!"

"Hey Mitchell, good to see you again. Ya thanks a lot for not killing me", Dane laughed.

"You won't get into trouble for doing this", Checka asked.

"We may get into. But I don't think we will. Because you take a look at the stupid order. Search for Dane everywhere and kill him if found within the Castle's territory. I believe even Shane wants him to leave as quickly as possible, and not kill him. Looks like he's still the softie, as he once was, no matter how much of a despot he tries to act", Mitch started laughing.

Checka, Chen, the old lady and everybody was surprised looking at Mitch.

"But I'll suggest, you all bid your farewell and return back to your homes. Shane may not like a commotion here. And if he sends the Dark Knights, even we cannot do anything, we're all puny soldiers, like you're all puny peasants", Mitch started laughing again.

This time even the rest of them started laughing. They bid their farewells to Dane. Chen has given him a blank paper. Because she doesn't have anything to tell him right now. She says she's tired. But if she finds something interesting, it'll show up in the blank page. So it's best to preserve it and not make paper planes or boats is what she had to say before leaving. Checka and the old lady wished him goodluck and left.

The guards escorted Dane out of the Duke's territory.

There is still some path to cover.
