- One of the most fundamental courses of Computer Science (also very interesting)
- Helps understand theoretical aspect of Computation
- Mainly discusses about what kind of things can be computed mechanically, how fast, and how much space is required

One fundamental enquiry of ToC is what problem can be computed and what cannot be?

Example -

- A program that accepts all valid Rust code, can be designed
- A program that checks whether a program will be stuck in a loop or it will stop, cannot be designed
