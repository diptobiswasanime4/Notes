Let's say we want to create a [[Finite State Machine (FSM)|FSM]] that give's [[1's & 2's Complement|2's complement]] of a Binary number

We create a Mealy Machine

![[Mealy Machine 2's complement.excalidraw]]

Then convert the same to Moore Machine

![[Moore Machine 2's complement.excalidraw]]

We see that the Moore Machine is producing 1 extra bit for a given input 10100

So they're not exactly the same. We have to ignore the LSM to get the same result.
