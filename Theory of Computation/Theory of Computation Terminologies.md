## Symbol

Any character is a symbol. Example - a, b, 1, 0, etc.
## Alphabet

A finite Collection of symbols is called Alphabet $\sum$ Example - {a, b}, {a, b, 0, 1}, etc.
## String

Sequence of symbols is called string. Example - a, b, 1, 0, ab, aaa, etc.
## Language

Set of strings over an Alphabet is called a Language. Can be *finite* or *infinite* (Even English is also a Language according to this definition over Alphabets A-Z)

Example - We have Alphabet $\sum$ = {0, 1}

We can have languages,

$L_1$ = Set of all Strings of length 2 = {00, 01, 10, 11} (finite Set)

$L_2$ = Set of all Strings that begin with 0 = {00, 01, 000, 001, 010, 011, 0000, ... } (infinite set)
## Powers of $\sum$

$\sum ^ 0$ = Set of all Strings of length 0 = { $\large \epsilon$ }

$\sum ^ 1$ = Set of all Strings of length 1 = {0, 1}

$\sum ^ n$ = Set of all Strings of length n
## Cardinality

Total number of elements in a set is called Cardinality.

Cardinality of $\sum ^ n$ = $\large 2 ^ n$

$\large \sum ^ *$ = Set of all possible Strings of {0, 1} = { $\large \epsilon$ } U {0, 1} U {00, 01, 10, 11} U ...
