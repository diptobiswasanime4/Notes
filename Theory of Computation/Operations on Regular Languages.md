## Union

A U B = { x | x $\large \epsilon$ A or x $\large \epsilon$ B }
## Concatenation

A o B = { xy | x $\large \epsilon$ A and x $\large \epsilon$ B }
## Star

A* = { $\large x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_k$ | k >= 0 and each $\large x_i$ $\large \epsilon$ A}
## Theorems

If you have 2 [[Regular Language|Regular Languages]]

1. Their Union will also be a Regular Language
2. Their Concatenation will also be a Regular Language
