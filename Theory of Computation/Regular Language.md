A language is considered to be a Regular Language if and only if a [[Finite State Machine (FSM)]] recognizes it.

So not Regular Languages are:

- Not recognized by FSM
- Languages that Require memory

Example - abbcccabbccc... is not a regular language because we have to store the repeating part abbccc
