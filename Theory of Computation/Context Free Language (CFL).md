In formal language theory, a Context Free Language is a language generated by some Context Free Grammar.

The set of all CFL is identical to the set of languages accepted by [[Introduction to Pushdown Automata (PDA)|Pushdown Automata]]

CFL is also defined by 4 tuples G = { G, $\sum$, S, P }

where,

V = Set of variables or non-Terminal symbols
$\sum$ = Set of Terminal symbols
S = Start symbol
P = Production Rule

CFL has a Production Rule of the form

A $\longrightarrow$ a

where,

a = { V U $\sum$ }* and A $\in$ V
