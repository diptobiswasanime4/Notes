All states that can be reached from a particular state only by seeing the $\in$ symbol is called $\in$-Closure, also written as $\in$*

To convert,

we have to check where does each state goes in the following order,

1. $\in$*
2. input
3. $\in$*

Any state that can reach the final state only by $\in$ symbol is a Final State
