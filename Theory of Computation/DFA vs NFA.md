## DFA

- Comes from Determinism
- Given current state we know what is the next state
- Has only 1 unique next state
- Has no choices or randomness
- Very simple and easy to design

![[DFA excal.excalidraw]]
## NFA

- Comes from non-Determinism
- Given current state we can have multiple next states
- Next state may be chosen at random
- All the next states could be chosen in parallel

![[NFA excal.excalidraw]]
