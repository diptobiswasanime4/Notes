A Grammar G can be formally defined using 4 tuples G = ( V, T, S, P )

where,

V = Set of variables or non-Terminal symbols, (finite, non-empty)
T = Set of Terminal Symbols, (finite, non-empty)
S = Start symbol, (only 1)
P = Production rules for Terminals and non-Terminals, (finite, non-empty)

Production rules has the form $\large \alpha \longrightarrow \beta$ where $\large \alpha, \beta$ are strings on V U T and at least one symbol of $\large \alpha$ belongs to V

The set of all Strings that can be derived from a Grammar is called the Language generated from that Grammar
