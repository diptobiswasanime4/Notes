$\large \in$-NFA is defined with a [[Tuple]] containing 5 values:

Q = Set of all states
$\sum$ = Inputs
$\large q_o$ = Initial State
F = Set of final states
$\large \delta$ = Transition function from $Q$ x $\sum$ x $\large \in$ $\longrightarrow$ $\large 2 ^ Q$

Every state on $\in$ goes to itself, unless mentioned otherwise
