There are several properties of several kinds.
## Commutative

1. S + R = R + S

		a* + b = b + a*

2. S.R $\neq$ R.S (not always)

		a.a* = a*.a (special case)

$+$ is Commutative but . is not
## Associative

1. R + (S + T) = (R + S) + T

		a* + (b + c*) = (a* + b) + c*

2. R(S.T) = (R.S)T

		a*(b.c*) = (a*.b)c*

Both $+$ and . are Associative
## Distributive

1. R(S + T) = R.S + R.T

2. R + (S.T) $\neq$ (R + S)(R + T) (not always)

$+$ is Distributive but . is not
## Identity

1. r + $\phi$ = r = $\phi$ + r

2. r.$\in$ = r = $\in$.r
