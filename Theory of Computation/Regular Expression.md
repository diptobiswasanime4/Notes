Regular Expressions are used for representing certain sets of strings in an Algebraic fashion.

1. Any terminal symbol, including ^ and $\large \phi$ are Regex
2. The Union U of 2 regex is also a regex
3. The Concatenation of 2 regex is also a regex
4. The Closure * of a regex is also a regex
5. The regex over $\sum$ are obtained by recursively applying the above rules 1, 2, 3 & 4 once or more
## Identities of Regex

1. $\large \phi$ + R = R
2. $\large \phi$R + R$\large \phi$ = $\large \phi$
3. $\in$R = R$\in$ = R
