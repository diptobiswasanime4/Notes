A Pushdown Automata (PDA) is a way to implement a [[Context Free Grammar]] in a similar way [[Finite State Machine (FSM)|Finite Automata]] is used to design for [[Regular Grammar]]

- PDA is more powerful than FSM
- PDA can store memory

In simpler words, PDA = FSM + [[Stack]]
## Components

1. Input tape
2. Finite Control Unit
3. Stack with infinite size
