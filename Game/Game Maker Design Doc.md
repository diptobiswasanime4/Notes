# Introduction

Game Maker is a Software to make Games.

I'll be working on this for a while, meanwhile any other ideas I get, I will put it in the [[Shiny Object Tracker]]

# Vision

1. Users can make Games (primarily Platformer, 2D RPG, Strategy Games) by interacting (drag-n-drop) with the UI with no knowledge of Coding

## Shiny Objects

1. There is also a plan to include 3D Games. But due to the Complexity and little to no similarity, for the time being I'm classifying it as a [[Shiny Object]]
2. There are also plans for developing [[Game Maker Desktop]] but not for the current release

# Features

Features can be divided into:

1. **2D RPG Game** (like Pokemon, Zenonia, etc.)
	1. Free World, e.g. Zenonia
	2. Grid World, e.g. Pokemon
2. **Platformer Game** (like Mario)
3. **Strategy Game** (like AOE, Civilization)
	1. Time based, e.g. AOE
	2. Turn based, e.g. Civ
## 2D RPG Game

### Free World

### Grid World

1. **Map Maker** - Maps can be made by mouse-click and mouse-drag with several terrain types (Grass, Water, Mountain, Sand, Concrete etc.)
	1. Maps can be exported as arrays, also imported as arrays, in JSON format (for now)
	2. Items can be placed over Maps, import-export can be done
	3. Players can be placed over Maps
2. **Sprite Animation** will automate several kinds of Sprite animation (Idle, Walk, Attack, etc.) with key presses (tricky but must be done)
	1. Sprites must support drag-n-drop
3. **Player Dialogs** must be done using UI
4. **DB Update & Sync** so that we can pause and make the Game
5. **Play Button** to play the Game
6. **Export Game** to export the Game as Code
7. **Launch Game** to launch the Game as a sub-domain (tricky but must be done)

## Platformer Game

1. **Tile Maker** - Tiles can be made by mouse-click and mouse-drag with several terrain types (Grass, Water, Cloud, Swamp, Concrete etc.) with auto-Gravity
	1. Tiles can be exported as arrays, also imported as arrays, in JSON format (for now)
	2. Items can be placed over Tiles, import-export can be done
	3. Players can be placed over Tiles
2. **Sprite Animation** will automate several kinds of Sprite animation (Idle, Walk, Attack, etc.) with key presses (tricky but must be done)
	1. Sprites must support drag-n-drop
3. **Player Dialogs** must be done using UI
4. **DB Update & Sync** so that we can pause and make the Game
5. **Play Button** to play the Game
6. **Export Game** to export the Game as Code
7. **Launch Game** to launch the Game as a sub-domain (tricky but must be done)

## Strategy Game

### Time based

1. **Map Maker** - Maps can be made by mouse-click and mouse-drag with several terrain types (Grass, Water, Mountain, Sand, Waterfall, etc.)
	1. Maps can be exported as arrays, also imported as arrays, in JSON format (for now)
	2. Resources can be placed over Maps, import-export can be done
	3. Players can be placed over Maps
2. **Building Design** - Buildings can be placed in the Map
	1. Buildings will produce troops
3. **Troop Movement** - Troop selection and movement using mouse
4. **Resource Tracker** - Resources must be tracked for all the players
5. **AI Enemy** - tricky but must be done
6. **Multi-player** - tricky but must be done
7. **DB Update & Sync** so that we can pause and make the Game
8. **Play Button** to play the Game
9. **Export Game** to export the Game as Code
10. **Launch Game** to launch the Game as a sub-domain (tricky but must be done)

### Turn based
