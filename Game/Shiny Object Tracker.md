The Shiny Object Tracker keeps track of all the brilliant ideas, that unfortunately I have to postpone to work on my current big idea. No worries, once my current project is complete, I will start working on one of these brilliant ideas, but strictly not before.

Current Big Idea: [[Game Maker Design Doc|Game Maker]]

To not lose focus on my current big idea, I'll be tracking, some [[Shiny Object|Shiny Objects]] that're within (wild ideas that cannot be included in the current release) as well as outside the scope of the Project.

[[Shiny Object|Shiny Objects]] within [[Game Maker Design Doc|Game Maker]]:

1. [[Game Maker 3D]]
	1. Game Maker currently makes Platformer, 2D RPG, Strategy Games. But I plan to add 3D Games also.
2. [[Game Maker Desktop]]
	1. A [[Game Engine]] that can be downloaded, and used while offline, hence reaping the computing power of the [[CPU]] unlike the [[Web]] (possibly made using [[Rust]])
3. **Indian Architecture Style 2D RPG Game** made using Game Maker
	1. An immersive Game
	2. A Gurukul environment (like Ninja Boy Rantaro)

[[Shiny Object|Shiny Objects]] outside [[Game Maker Design Doc|Game Maker]]:

1. [[Bengali Language Programming Language]]
	1. I have plans to Design a Compiler of a Bengali Programming Language
2. [[A New Operating System]]
	1. I have plans to write a new [[Operating System]] possibly in [[Rust]] (could be in another language also)
