## Enable & Disable

B = 0 is enable for OR Gate, and Y = A acts as buffer

B = 1 is disable for OR Gate, and Y = 1
## Unused Input

- In [[Transistor-Transistor-Logic (TTL)|TTL]] open inputs will act as 1
- In [[Emitter-Coupled Logic (ECL)|ECL]] open inputs will act as 0

There are 3 ways to deal with unused input:

1. Connect to 0
2. Connect to another used input
3. Use ECL logic, connect to 0 (using TCL logic will disable the Gate)
