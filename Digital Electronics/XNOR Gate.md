XNOR is the complement of [[XOR Gate]]
## Properties

$A \odot A = 1$
$A \odot \overline A = 0$
$A \odot 0 = \overline A$
$A \odot 1 = A$

$A \odot A \odot A... = A$ or 1

A  when n = odd
1 when n = even

XOR and XNOR are complements when we have even number of inputs,

n = even$\implies$$Y_{XOR} = 0$, $Y_{XNOR} = 1$ (when all inputs are A)

XOR and XNOR are same when we have odd number of inputs,

n = odd $\implies$ Y = A (when all inputs are )
