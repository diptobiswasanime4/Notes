NOR Gate along with [[NAND Gate]] are Universal Gates

NOR Gate along with [[NAND Gate]] doesn't follow associative law

NOR Gate is also called Bubbled AND Gate
## Enable & Disable

1 is disable, Y = 0

0 is enable
## Unused Input

Same as OR Gate

- In [[Transistor-Transistor-Logic (TTL)|TTL]] open inputs will act as 1
- In [[Emitter-Coupled Logic (ECL)|ECL]] open inputs will act as 0

There are 3 ways to deal with unused input:

1. Connect to 0
2. Connect to another used input
3. Use ECL logic, connect to 0 (using TCL logic will disable the Gate)
