## Using 1's Complement

1. Convert number to be subtracted to it's [[1's & 2's Complement|1's complement]] form
2. Perform addition
3. If final carry is 1, add it to the previous result. If final carry is 0, result obtained is negative, hence take it's 1's complement form
## Using 2's Complement

1. Convert the number to be subtracted to it's [[1's & 2's Complement|2's complement]] form
2. Perform addition
3. If final carry is 1, result is positive and in it's true form. If final carry is 0, result is negative and in it's 2's complement form. Hence we can ignore final carry in both cases.
