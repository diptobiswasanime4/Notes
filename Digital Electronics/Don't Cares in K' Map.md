Consider [[Truth Table]] of a function $f$ 

| A   | B   | Y   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | x   |
Here x is the Don't Care

It means we don't care whether x = 1 or 0

We can take whatever we want depending on our specific usecase

Generally for minterm we take x = 0, for maxterm we take x = 1, for [[Sum of Product (SOP)]] and [[Product of Sum (POS)]] form conversions
