Complement's are used in Digital Computers to simplify subtraction operation.

Complement is of two kinds:

1. r's complement or Radix complement
2. (r-1)'s complement or Diminished Radix complement

We have the formula,

r's complement = $r ^ n - N$

where,

N = the number
n = total number of digits
r = the base

And,

(r - 1)'s complement = $r ^ n - N - 1$

$\implies$ (r - 1)'s complement = $r ^ n - 1 - N$

$\implies$ (r - 1)'s complement = r's complement - 1

$\implies$ (r - 1)'s complement + 1 = r's complement
