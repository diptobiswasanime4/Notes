To manage [[Memory]] it is essential to have a hierarchy.

There are many factors to consider in a memory hierarchy:

1. Access time
2. Size
3. Cost
4. Usage frequency

In this Pyramid Access time, size decreases, and Cost, Usage frequency increases from base to top.
## [[Memory Interface]]

- This is part of [[Computer Organization]]
- Deals with connecting various levels of memory units with Processor & I/O Peripherals

Unit - MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)
