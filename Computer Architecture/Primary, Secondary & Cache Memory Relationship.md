Programs in the Computer permanently reside in the [[Secondary Memory]]. During exec the same programs turn into processes.

Now the processes are subdivided into equisized Pages. Similarly the [[Main Memory]] is also sub-divided into equisized Frames.

Also,

	Frame size = Page size

There is also a similar relationship between the [[Main Memory]] and the [[Cache]]

The sub-divisions of the [[Main Memory]] in this case are called blocks, and the sub-divisions of the [[Cache]] are called lines.

Again,

	Line size = Block size
### Word

Smallest addressable memory unit is called **word**

Byte-addressable memory implies,

	1 word = 1 byte
