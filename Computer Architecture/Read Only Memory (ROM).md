ROM stores [[Firmware]] and are non-volatile, unlike [[Random Access Memory (RAM)|RAM]] which is volatile.

One instance of firmware is called [[BIOS (Basic Input Output System)]] which is loaded in a ROM-chip, also called a BIOS-chip, which contains a [[Bootstrap Program]].

When we turn on our [[Computer]], it takes a while before the [[Operating System]] is loaded. So for the time-being the [[Operating System|OS]] is loading the Bootstrap program is in command.

Now, the black screen that we see after turning on our computer before the [[Operating System|OS]] is loaded of course is called the POST screen, meaning Power On Self Test. It does the following:

1. Check [[BIOS (Basic Input Output System)|BIOS]] & [[CMOS]] chip
2. Initialize the processor
3. Test associated Hardware components
4. Execute [[BIOS (Basic Input Output System)|BIOS]] instructions
5. Look for valid BOOT disk
6. Load [[Operating System|OS]] on the RAM

ROM can be classified into:

1. Programmable ROM
2. Erasable Programmable ROM
3. Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM
