Memory is the faculty by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when required.

Example - files, images, other media files, etc.

## Processors

Process store important memory in Registers.
## Types of Memory
### Primary Memory

This is the memory to perform immediate Tasks. Primary memory is fast.

Example - Opening an audio or video file, the [[Operating System]] manages the Primary Memory which is responsible for understanding the mouse or button-click, opening the default media application, and bringing the media file which is stored in the Secondary memory.
### Secondary Memory

This is the permanent storage. Example - [[Hard Disk Drive (HDD)]]

Secondary memory is:

1. Slower than Primary Memory
2. Much much bigger in size
3. Cost-effective
4. Permanent
5. Semi-Random access
### Random Access Memory (RAM)

Also called as Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) is a random contiguous memory location of the Primary Memory responsible for performing immediate tasks.
### Cache

Compared to RAM Cache is much faster but costly.

They are also called Static Random Access Memory or (SRAM)
