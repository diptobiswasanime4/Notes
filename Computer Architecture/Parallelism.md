Computer Architecture can be classified based on how they execute instructions.
## Types

1. SISD (Single Instruction stream, Single Data stream)
2. SIMD (Single Instruction stream, Multiple Data streams)
3. MISD (Multiple Instruction streams, Single Data stream)
4. MIMD (Multiple Instruction streams, Multiple Data streams)

This classification was proposed by [[Michel J Flynn]] in 1966. So this classification is also called **Flynn's Taxonomy**
