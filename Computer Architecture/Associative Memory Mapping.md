Associative Memory Mapping is required to resolve the [[Types of Cache Miss|Conflict Miss]] in [[Direct Memory Mapping]]

In Associative Mapping any block can be assigned to any of the Cache Lines

The PA bits here are hence divided only into 2 parts (instead of 3):

1. Tag bits
2. Block/ Line offset

One disadvantage of Associative mapping is that there is no clue where a particular memory block is present
