In everyday life we do lots of things, some useful, some useless. We do it consciously, also sub-consciously. Any action when we take notice, is a thought before.

But what is a thought? Do we create thoughts? Or thoughts create us? Like Descartes used to say "I think, therefore, I am"

Considering that we exist before our thoughts, where do thoughts come from? They come from the Deep Darkness of the Mind, like bubbles, when they surface, we take notice. This analogy was also used by Swamy Sarvapriyananda.

Instead of thinking, this is something we should take notice. Most of our mind is unknown to us. It's Dark Waters. We don't know it's breadth or depth. But we know that it is hiding wonders. Everything best and worst in the world is already in it. But we don't know how to get it.

When some thoughts bubble up, we take action. But often that doesn't do anything meaningful. Maybe because we wanted some wonderous thoughts, but got something boring. Sometimes this unknown frontier of our mind is also quite scary. It's also our Dark-side.

Meditation is the deliberate practice of coming to terms with our Mind, the whole of our mind, the unknown and the unknown. But it also helps us slowly take a dive into the unknown depths of our mind. We get lots of ideas that we otherwise won't get. Meditation reminds us that our life is not 2D or 3D it is multi-D or nD

So it's not always necessary to act on any thought. Sometimes thoughts misguide us. Because thoughts that will pop us is also shaped up to a large extent by our worldly activities. So we should try to consciously create thoughts instead that will have a positive impact on our mind. By consulting with our Intellect.

Intellect is also a faculty of our mind. But that is in the light. Intellect is very well-known. Intellect is our friend. But Intellect is very weak. It can motivate us. But when we need consistency, it unfortunately cannot help much.

We should always practice to tame our mind. Practice will make us perfect!
