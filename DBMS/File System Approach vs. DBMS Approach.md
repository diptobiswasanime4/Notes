## File System Approach

In the File System Approach, [[Data]] is stored in [[File|files]]. Multiple files are created to store data depending on interests, hence often resulting in duplication of data and redundancy.
## DBMS Approach

In the DBMS Approach, [[Data]] is stored in a single [[Repository]]. Multiple Users can view data depending on their interests, sometimes with the help of Querying languages. Example - [[SQL]]

DBMS Approach is preferred over the File System Approach.

Problems with DBMS approach can only be because of Skill issue.
