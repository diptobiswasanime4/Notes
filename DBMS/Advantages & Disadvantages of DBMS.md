9. Permitting Inferencing and Actions Using Rules
## Disadvantages

1. Overhead cost
	1. High initial investment
	2. Overhead for security, concurrency control, recovery
	3. Training of IT team, skill issues
2. Might be an overkill when Database & applications is simple, well-defined, and little to no changes
3. DBMS approach may not be used when Multiple-user access and [[Concurrency|concurrency]] is not required
## Additional Implications of Using Database Approach

1. Potential for enforcing Standards
	1. [[Database Administrator]] may define and enforce standards among [[Database Users]]
	2. Standards facilitate communication & co-operation within the organization, but may also increase complexity & confusion
2. Reduced [[Application Development]] time
3. Improved Flexibility
4. Availability of up-to-the-last-minute info - Due to multiple user access and [[Concurrency|concurrency]]
5. Economies of Scale
