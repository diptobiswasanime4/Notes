Amazon Elastic Transcoder lets developers convert media files stored in [[S3 (Simple Storage Service)|Amazon S3]] into formats required by consumer playback devices.

Elastic Transcoder has 4 components:

1. **Jobs** do the work of transcoding
2. **Pipelines** are queues that manage transcoding jobs
3. **Presets** are templates that contain most of the settings for transcoding media files from one format to another
4. **Notifications** enable developers to optionally configure Elastic Transcoder and [[Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)]] to keep them informed about the status of a job
