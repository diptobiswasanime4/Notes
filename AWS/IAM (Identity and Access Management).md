AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS web service that allows users to securely control access to [[AWS|AWS resources]]

After creating an AWS account, user logs in with a [[Root User|Root account]]. It is recommended to create an [[IAM User|IAM account]] and only then start using AWS services.

[[Root User]] is only kept for checking bills or contacting AWS support team.
