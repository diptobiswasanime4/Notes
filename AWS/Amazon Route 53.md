Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable [[Domain Name System (DNS)]] web service.

## When to use Amazon Route 53 ?

Developers can use Route 53 to perform 3 main functions:

1. **Register Domain names**
2. **Routing Internet traffic** - When a user opens a web browser and enters our domain (abc.com) or subdomain name (abc.def.com), Route 53 helps connect the browser with the web app.
3. **Checking health of resources** - Route 53 sends automated requests to a resource, like a web server, to verify it is reachable, available and functional. Users may also receive notifications when a resource becomes unavailable.
