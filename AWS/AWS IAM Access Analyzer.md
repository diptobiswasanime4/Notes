AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps users set, verify, and refine IAM policies by providing a suite of capabilities.

**External Access Analyzers** help identify potential risk of accessing resources by enabling developers identify any resource policies that grant access to an external principal.

**Unused Access Analyzers** help identify potential identity risks by enabling developers identify unused IAM roles, unused access keys, unused console passwords, and IAM principals with unused service and action-level permissions.
