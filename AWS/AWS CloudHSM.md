AWS CloudHSM combines the benefits of [[AWS|AWS]] with the security of Hardware Security Modules (HSM)

A HSM is a computing device that processes cryptographic operations and provides secure storage for cryptographic keys.
## Benefits

1. HSMs are FIPS 140-2 level-3 validated
2. E2E (end-to-end) encryption is not visible to AWS
3. Full control of keys, algorithms, and application development
4. Migrate cryptographic workloads to the cloud
5. Access to FIPS and non-FIPS clusters
