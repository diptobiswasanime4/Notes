AWS CloudTrail Lake connects existing events in row-based JSON format to Apache ORC format (ORC is a columnar storage format that is optimized for fast retrieval of data), and lets developers run SQL-based queries on events.
### CloudTrail Lake event data stores

Developers can copy events to new or existing data store to create a point-in-time snapshot of events logged to the trail. All events in a data store are encrypted by [[AWS CloudTrail|CloudTrail]]

Developers can control access to actions on event data stores by using authorization based on tags.

CloudTrail Lake dashboard visualizes the data of the event data store.
### CloudTrail integrations

CloudTrail integrations enables developers to log and store user activity from outside of AWS, such as hybrid, or on-prem applications.
### CloudTrail Lake queries

CloudTrail Lake queries offer a deep and more customizable view of events than running LookupEvents.
