Access control lists (ACLs) allow users to manage access to [[S3 (Simple Storage Service)|S3]] buckets and objects, by attaching an ACL to it as a sub-resource, that specifies groups and permissions.

When a new bucket is created, [[S3 (Simple Storage Service)|Amazon S3]] creates a default ACL and grants full control to the resource owner, that is specified in an XML file.

### Who is a grantee ?
