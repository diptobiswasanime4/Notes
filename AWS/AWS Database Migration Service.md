AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) makes it possible to migrate [[Relational Database|relational databases]], data warehouses, NoSQL databases, and other types of data stores.

DMS at a basic level is a server in the [[AWS|AWS Cloud]] that runs replication software. Here developers create a source and target connection and tells DMS where to extract data from and where to load it.
## Features

1. To discover source data infra, developers can use DMS Fleet Advisor
2. To migrate to a different database engine, developers can use Schema Conversion
3. After converting source Schemas, DMS can be used to migrate data
