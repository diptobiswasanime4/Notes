Trusted Advisor inspects [[AWS|AWS environments]] and makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve performance, or security.

With a Basic Developer Support Plan, developers can use the Trusted Advisor console to access all checks in the Service Limits category and 6 checks in the Security category.

It's about money!
