Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the most popular service in [[AWS]] that provides users with on-demand and scalable Computing capacity in the [[Cloud]] (kind of like a virtual server or computer)

The EC2 instance is secured within a [[Security Group]] which is a virtual firewall that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic. A [[Security Group]] is part of a [[VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)]] which is deployed on an [[Availability Zone]]
