Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps developers ensure that an optimum number of [[EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)|EC2 instances]] are available to handle the load of the application.

This is done by creating collections of EC2 instances, also known as Auto Scaling Groups. Developers can specify policies, that'll determine how Auto Scaling will work.
