AWS Migration Hub provides single place to discover existing servers, plan migrations, and track the status of each application migration, providing visibility into the application portfolio and hence streamlines planning and tracking.

Migration Hub supports two kinds of migration:

1. [[AWS Application Migration Service]]
2. [[AWS Database Migration Service]]

AWS Migration Hub Console can be used to access these services.
