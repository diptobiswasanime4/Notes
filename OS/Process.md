When user writes a program, example.c it will be saved in a file, stored in [[Secondary Memory]] that is [[Hard Disk Drive (HDD)]]

After compiling it we will get a.out which is also stored in Secondary Memory

When we run a.out a process is created, i.e. a Process Data Structure is created inside the [[Main Memory]]

[[Scheduler]] takes a Program from Secondary Memory, converts it into a Process and puts it into the Main Memory, then takes the Process and hands it over to the [[CPU]] for execution 

![[Process Data Structure.excalidraw]]

So Program is like the Body

And Process is like the Life-force

Because without Process we cannot execute a Program, it will only be stored in the Hard Disk
