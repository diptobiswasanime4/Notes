When [[CPU]] is available, it is assigned to the process that has the smallest next CPU burst

SJF can be both preemptive and non-preemptive

Hence a more appropriate term for this [[Algorithm]] could be Shortest-Next-CPU-Burst Algorithm
## Problems

1. It is very difficult, sometimes impossible to find out the length of the next CPU burst
2. SJF cannot be implemented at the level of short-term CPU scheduling, although it is optimal
