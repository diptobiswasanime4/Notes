An address generated by the [[CPU]] is called **Logical Address**

An address seen by the memory unit, that is, loaded into the memory-address Register of the memory is called **Physical Address**

Compile-time and Load-time Address binding methods generate identical Logical and Physical Addresses

Execution-time Address binding scheme results in differing Logical and Physical addresses

In this case we refer to the Logical Address as a Virtual Address

**Logical Address Space** is the set of all logical addresses generated by a program

**Physical Address Space** is the set of all Physical addresses corresponding to these logical addresses

The [[Runtime]] mapping from virtual to physical addresses is done by a [[Hardware]] device called the [[Memory Management Unit (MMU)]]

![[Relocation Register excal.excalidraw]]

Logical addresses are in the range of 0 to max

Physical addresses are in the range ( R + 0 ) to ( R + max )
