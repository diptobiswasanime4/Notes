Operating Systems share some common features. Two very important ones are:

1. Multiprogramming
2. Time Sharing (Multitasking)
## Multiprogramming

- A single user cannot keep the [[Central Processing Unit (CPU)|CPU]] and I/O devices busy at all times
- Multiprogramming increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs, so that CPU is never free

Multiprogramming systems provide an environment in which the various system resources are utilized effectively, without providing user interaction with the Computer system.
## Time Sharing (Multitasking)

- [[Central Processing Unit (CPU)|CPU]] executes multiple jobs by switching among them
- Switch occurs so frequently that users can interact with the program in real-time, thinking that the whole system belongs to them, although not

Multitasking uses CPU scheduling and Multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of a time-shared computer.
