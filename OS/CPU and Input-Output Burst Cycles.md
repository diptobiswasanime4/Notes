Process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O wait, alternating between two states.

Process execution begins with CPU burst, followed by I/O burst, followed by CPU burst, so on, and so on.

**CPU burst** is when process is being executed in CPU

**I/O burst** is when CPU is waiting for I/O for further execution
