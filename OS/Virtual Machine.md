Virtual Machine is the abstraction of [[Hardware]] of a single [[Computer]] ([[CPU]], Disk Drives, Network Interface cards, etc.) into several different execution environments, hence creating the illusion that each separate execution environment is running it's own private Computer.

Virtual Machine has 2 parts:

1. VM Software (e.g. [[VMware Workstation]]) - Runs in Kernel Mode
2. VM instance - Runs in User Mode

Consequently we have, which both are part of the VM instance and hence run in User Mode:

1. Virtual User Mode
2. Virtual Kernel Mode
