First Come First Serve (FCFS) is the simplest [[CPU Scheduling]] [[Algorithm]]

It means the process that requests the [[CPU]] first, should be allocated the CPU first.

Implementation of FCFS can easily be managed through FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue

If processes with higher burst time arrive before processes with lower burst time, then smaller processes have to wait for a long time for bigger processes to release the CPU. This is also called **Convoy Effect**

FCFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm
