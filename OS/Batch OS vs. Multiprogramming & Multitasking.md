After a long time, the user will collect the output. Here only 1 job is finished at a time.

These were in use in 1980s

Multiprogramming & Multitasking is where every job will be executed a little bit at a time. All jobs share the [[CPU]], hence every job gets a chance frequently

2. Also the user will feel like, they're interacting with all the programs live
