Peterson's solution provides a good algorithmic description of solving critical-section problems and illustrates some of the complexities involved in designing software that address the requirements of mutual exclusion and bounded waiting requirements.

Peterson's solution is restricted to two processes that alternate execution between their critical sections and remainder sections

Peterson's solution requires two data items to be shared between two processes:

1. int turn - indicates whose turn it is to enter its critical section
2. boolean flag - An array of 2 values, used to indicate if a process is ready to enter its critical section
## Limitations

1. Classic software based solution to the [[Critical-Section Problem]]
2. May not work properly on Modern Computer Architecture
