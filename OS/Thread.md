A program can have a number of processes.

Each process can have a number of threads.

Thread comprises of:

1. Thread ID
2. [[Program Counter]]
3. Register set
4. Stack

Thread shares code section, data section, and other operating-system resources, such as files and signals with other threads belonging to the same process.

If a process has multiple threads of control, it can perform more than one task at a time.
