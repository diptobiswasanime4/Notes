While designing an Operating system the 1st problem that we face is defining Goals and specifications.

Some of the requirements are:

1. Choice of Hardware
2. Type of System

Goals can also be divided into:

1. User Goals - Convenient to use, Easy to learn, Reliable, safe, fast
2. System Goals - Easy to design, implement, maintain, operate, error-free, efficient

But once again these requirements cannot be measured.
## Mechanisms and Policies

Mechanisms determine how to do something.

Policies determine what will be done.

*One important principle is the separation of policy from mechanism*

(Mixing of mechanism and policy is like hard-coding values in code, for every new requirement new code has to be written, which is terrible)

If a resource needs to be allocated to a process is determined by a policy, and how the resource allocation will be done is a mechanism. Hence, change in policy will not affect the OS.

Once Design is complete we have to [[Implementation of Operating System|Implement the OS]]
