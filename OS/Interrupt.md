Interrupt is a signal, emitted by a device attached to a [[Computer]]

The Operating System intervenes and determines what to do next.

Hardware may trigger an interrupt any time by sending a signal to the [[Central Processing Unit (CPU)|CPU]], usually through the [[System Bus]]

When interrupted, the [[CPU]] stops what is is doing and immediately transfers execution to a fixed location, which contains the starting address where the [[Service Routine]] of the interrupt is located. The Interrupt Service Routine executes. Upon completion, the CPU resumes the interrupted activity.
