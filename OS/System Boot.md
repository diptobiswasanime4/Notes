The procedure of starting a [[Computer]] by loading the [[Kernel]] is known as System Boot

On most Computer Systems, a small piece of code also known as the [[Bootstrap Program]] or Bootstrap loader locates the Kernel

The Bootstrap Program is in the form of [[Read Only Memory (ROM)]] because the [[Random Access Memory (RAM)]] is in an unknown state at System Startup. ROM is convenient because it needs no initialization and cannot be infected by [[Computer Virus]]

When the full Bootstrap Program is loaded, and it can traverse the File System and locate the OS Kernel, then load it into [[Memory]] and start execution, only at this point of time the system can be called as Running
