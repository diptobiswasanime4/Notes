We can deal with [[Deadlock|Deadlocks]] in one of the 3 ways:

1. Use a protocol to prevent or avoid deadlocks, ensuring that system doesn't enter a deadlock state (we use [[Deadlock Prevention]] or [[Deadlock Avoidance]])
2. Allow the system to enter a deadlock state, detect it and recover
3. Ignore the problem and pretend that deadlocks never occur in the system (Here we leave it to the application programmers to write programs efficiently so that their application doesn't cause any deadlock, because it won't be handled by the OS)
