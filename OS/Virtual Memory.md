**Virtual Memory** is a storage scheme where secondary memory can be treated as though it is a part of [[Main Memory]] and large processes can be stored in it. Only the part of the process that is actually needed for execution will be loaded on to the actual main memory

- Virtual Memory involves the separation of logical memory as perceived by users from physical memory
- This separation, allows an extremely large virtual memory to be provided for programmers when only a smaller physical memory is available
