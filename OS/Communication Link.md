If two processes want to communicate they can do so by a Communication Link.

There are several ways how the Link can be logically implemented:

1. Direct or indirect communication
2. Synchronous or asynchronous communication
3. Automatic or explicit buffering

There are also some problems in doing so:

1. [[Communication Link - Naming|Naming]]
2. [[Communication Link - Synchronization|Synchronization]]
3. [[Communication Link - Buffering|Buffering]]
