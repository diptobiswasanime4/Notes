Generally we have 5 [[CPU Scheduling]] criteria:

1. CPU utilization - We want the [[CPU]] to be as busy as possible
2. Throughput - Number of processes that are completed per time unit
3. Turnaround Time - Sum of time periods waiting to get into memory, waiting in the ready queue, executing on the [[CPU]], and doing I/O
4. Waiting Time - Sum of time periods spent waiting in the ready queue
5. Response Time - Time taken from submission of a request until first response is produced
