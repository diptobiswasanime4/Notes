Once an [[Design of Operating System|OS is designed]], it must be implemented.

- Traditionally Operating Systems have been written in [[Assembly Language]]
- Now, Operating Systems are mostly written in higher-level languages like C/C++, [[Rust]], etc.
## Advantages of Writing OS in high-level Languages

1. Code can be written faster
2. Code is more compact
3. Code is easier to understand and Debug
4. OS is more portable
	- OS written in Assembly Language is [[Hardware]] specific. Example - [[MS-DOS]] is available only on Intel family of CPUs
	- [[Linux|Linux OS]] in contrast is written in C and is available on a number of different CPUs
