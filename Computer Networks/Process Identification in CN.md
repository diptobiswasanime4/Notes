To establish a connection from a Network A to another Network B there are 3 steps:

1. Identify the Network
2. Identify the Host
3. Identify the Process

![[Identify a Process in CN steps.excalidraw]]

To do this we have:

1. [[IP Address]] - IP Address has 2 parts
	1. Network ID - that identifies the Network
	2. Host ID - that identifies the Host (this is not sufficient, so we need PA, i.e. [[MAC Address]])
2. [[Port Address]] - a number to identify the process

When we're sending message from 1 host to 1 host it is called Unicasting
