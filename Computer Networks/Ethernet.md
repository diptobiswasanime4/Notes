Ethernet is one of the most widely used Wired LAN technologies

Ethernet operates in both the [[Physical Layer]] and the [[Data Link Layer]]

Ethernet evolution has 4 stages:

1. Standard Ethernet
2. Fast Ethernet
3. Gigabit Ethernet
4. Ten-Gigabit Ethernet

Ethernet can be of 2 types:

1. Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
2. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)

**Crosstalk** is when UTP cable does not use shielding to counter the effects of EMI and RFI

Negative effect of crosstalk can be limited by increasing the number of twists
