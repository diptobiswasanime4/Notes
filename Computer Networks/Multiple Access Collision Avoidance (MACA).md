MACA resolves the [[Hidden Terminal Problem]] and [[Exposed Terminal Problem]]

- The sender and receiver will exchange control frames with each other before the sender actually transmits the data.
- This exchange informs all nearby nodes that a transmission is about to begin
- Sender transmits a Request to Send (RTS) frame to receiver
- Receiver replies with a Clear to Send (CTS) frame to sender
