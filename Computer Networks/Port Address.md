When two [[Computer|Computers]] in a Computer Network wants to interact with each other, they require [[IP Address]] and [[MAC Address]] of each other. But when they want to talk to specific processes of the Computer they need Port numbers.

1. In a node, there are many processes running
2. Data sent/ received must reach the right process
3. Every process is uniquely identified by Port numbers
4. Port numbers can be fixed and dynamic (0-65535)
	1. Fixed Port number - 25, 80, etc.
	2. Dynamic Port number - 64323. Assigned to a new process, like a new Google Chrome tab

2. Attach source MAC address and dest. MAC address. Required by Switch
3. Attach source Port number and dest. Port number. Required by [[Operating System]]
