OSI stands for Open System Interconnection.

OSI Model is for understanding and designing a Network Architecture that is flexible, robust and interoperable. It is developed by International Standards for Organizations (ISO)

OSI Model is only a guideline, and is not a protocol. It is never fully implemented.

The primary purpose of the OSI Model is to show how to facilitate [[Data Communication]] between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of the underlying [[Hardware]] and [[Software]]
