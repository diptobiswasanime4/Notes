Any form of communication must have below things in common:

1. Source or sender
2. Destination or receiver
3. Channel or media

Protocols are the rules that govern the various methods of communication.

Protocols determine:

1. What is communicated ?
2. How it is communicated ?
3. When it is communicated ?
## Human Communication

We may not be aware of it but Protocols are necessary even for human communication:

1. There must at least be a speaker and a listener
2. Sender and Receiver must use a Common language and grammar
3. Speed and timing of speech and communication should be consistent
4. Parties involved must agree to communicate
## Elements in Network Communication

1. Message encoding
2. Message formatting and encapsulation
3. Message timing
4. Message size
5. Message delivery options

### Message Formatting and Encapsulation

This is the agreed format of the message, then encapsulating the information to identify the sender and the receiver correctly.
### Message Timing

Speed of sending and receiving messages must be consistent. Acknowledgements must be gracefully handled after communication.
### Message Size

Long messages must be broken into smaller pieces to travel across a network.
### Message Delivery Options

1. Unicast - Means one sender and one receiver (like Personal chat)
2. Multicast - Means one sender and many receivers (like Group chat)
3. Broadcast - Sender sends data to all participants in the network.
