[[Computer Network|Computer Networks]] should have 4 basic features:

1. Fault Tolerance
2. Scalability
3. Quality of Service (QoS)
4. Security

## Fault Tolerance

1. Continue working despite failures
2. Ensuring there is no loss of service

## Scalability

1. Grow and shrink according to demand and supply (similar to [[Elasticity]] in [[Cloud Computing]])
2. Performance should not be affected by growing and shrinking

## Quality of Service (QoS)

1. Set priorities while handling data. Example - Phone call should have higher priority than email. Because there should be no delay in Phone call, but a small amount of delay in email is acceptable.
2. Manage data traffic to reduce data loss, delay, etc.

## Security

1. Should prevent:
	1. Unauthorized access
	2. Misuse
	3. Forgery
2. Should provide [[CIA Triad]]:
	1. Confidentiality
	2. Integrity
	3. Availability
