Host Computer has an Ethernet Adaptor where the [[Ethernet]] cable is attached

The Algorithm is commonly called Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) which is implemented in the [[Hardware]] on the Network Adaptor. It uses [[CSMA-CD]]

Manchester Encoding Technique is used for converting data bits into [[Signal|signals]]

**Ethernet Transmitter Algorithm** states that when an Adapter has a frame to send and the line is idle, it transmits the frame immediately

**Runt frame** is an Ethernet frame that is less that the IEEE 802.3's minimum length of 64 bytes. Runt frames are most commonly caused by collisions

The strategy of doubling the delay interval between each retransmission attempt is known as **Exponential Backoff**
