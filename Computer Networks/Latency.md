**Latency** is the duration it takes for an entire message to completely arrive at the destination from the time the first bit is sent out from the source

Latency is made of 4 components:

1. Transmission delay - TIme takes to place the complete Data [[Packet]] on transmission medium
2. Propagation delay - Time taken for a bit to go from device A to B
3. Queueing delay - Time taken by intermediary device to hold the message
4. Processing delay - Time end node takes to process the message

Latency = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
