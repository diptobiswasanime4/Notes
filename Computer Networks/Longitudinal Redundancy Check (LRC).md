- In LRC block of bits is organized in rows and columns
- Parity bit is calculated for each column and set along the data
- Block of parity acts as the redundant bits
- LRC increases the likelihood of detecting burst errors
## Problem

If 2 bits in one data unit are damaged and 2 bits in exactly the same position of another data unit is also damaged the LRC will not be able to detect the error
