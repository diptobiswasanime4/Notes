Physical layer is the lowest layer of the [[OSI Model Layers]]

Physical Layer is responsible for transmitting bits over a medium. It also provides Electrical and Mechanical specifications. One of its major functions is to move data in the form of electromagnetic signals across the transmission medium.

Physical layer converts data into [[Signal|signals]]

Signals can be:

1. Electrical signal
2. Optical/ Light signal
3. Microwave signal
## Services

1. Physical characteristics of the media
2. Representation of bits
3. Data rate
4. Synchronization of bits
5. Line configuration
6. Physical topology
