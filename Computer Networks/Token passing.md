- Station is authorized to send data when it receives a special frame called **Token**
- If a Node doesn't have any data but got the Token, it will pass the Token to another Node
## Drawbacks

- If a Node fails to release the token, due to software issue or [[Cyberattack]]

1. Ring
2. Dual Ring
3. Bus Ring
4. Star
