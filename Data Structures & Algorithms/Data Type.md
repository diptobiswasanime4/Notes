Data Type has below properties:

1. Defines a domain of values
2. Defines operations allowed on those values

Example - float allows + - * / but doesn't allow %

**Abstract Data Type** defines operations on values using functions without specifying what is there inside the function and how the operations are performed.

Program that uses [[Data Structure]] is called **Client Program**

Program which implements the [[Data Structure]] is called the **implementation**

One advantage of this is, if the implementation of the Data Structure is changed in future, Client Program can still work in the same way.
