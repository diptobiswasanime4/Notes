Finite number of steps to solve a problem is called **Algorithm**

**Analysis** is the process of comparing two Algos wrt Time, Space, etc.

There are 2 kinds of Analysis:

1. Priory - Before execution, mostly analytical, gives approx value
2. Posterior - After execution, depends on [[Hardware]], gives exact value
