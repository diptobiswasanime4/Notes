Wild Pointers also called as uninitialized Pointers are [[Pointer|pointers]] that point to some arbitrary memory location and may cause a Program to misbehave.

To avoid this:

1. Initialize pointers with the address of a known variable
2. Allocate memory using malloc and put the values in the allocated memory
