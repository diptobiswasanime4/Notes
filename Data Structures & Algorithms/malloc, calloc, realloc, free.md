**malloc** is the short-form for "memory allocation" and it is used to dynamically allocate a single large block of contiguous block of memory according to the size specified by the user

It is a built-in function declared in the [[Header file]] <stdlib.h>

**calloc** is the short-form for "contiguous allocation" and it is used to allocate multiple blocks of memory

calloc requires 2 arguments when compared to malloc

**realloc** is the short-form for 're-allocation' and it is used to change the size of the memory block without losing old data.

**free** is used to release the dynamically allocated memory in heap (in the absence of [[Garbage Collector]] as in case of [[C]])
