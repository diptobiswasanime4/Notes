The quantities, characters or symbols on which operations are performed by a [[Computer]] which may be stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals and recorded on magnetic, optical or mechanical recording media is called **Data**

When Data is arranged in a systematic way so that it gets a structure and becomes meaningful is called **Information**

**Data Structure** is the systematic way to organize data so that it can be used efficiently.

Example - Instead of using 100 variables, we can use an [[Array]] of size 100
