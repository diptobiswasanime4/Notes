## Reasons to do this

1. Removes ambiguity
2. Easy manipulation
3. Able to solve puzzles

Example - You are not allowed to watch adult movies if your age is less than 18 years or you have no age proof.

q = You are allowed to watch adult movies
r = Your age is less than 18 years
s = You have age proof

Hence we have the Logical expression,

(r $\vee$ $\large \lnot$s) $\longrightarrow$ $\large \lnot$q
