Logic is the Science of reasoning.

With rules of logic, we can think about Mathematical Statements and we'd be able to prove or disprove those Mathematical statements precisely.

Statement:
	Sum of 1st n Natural numbers = n(n + 1) / 2

Either this is true or false. We can use logic to reason about it.

Purpose of logic is to construct valid arguments (or proofs)

Once a Mathematical statement is proved to be True, we can call it a **Theorem**

This is the basis of all of Mathematics.
