[[Mathematics]] can be divided into 2 parts:

1. Discrete
2. Continuous

Example -

- Natural numbers are discrete. Real numbers are continuous.
- Digital clock is discrete. Analog clocks are continuous.

Discrete Mathematics is the study of discrete objects, that is they are not connected, hence distinct.

It is not a branch of Mathematics, rather this is a collection of concepts with only one common property that they are discrete.
## Why Study

1. Develops Mathematical thinking
2. Improves problem solving ability
## Problems that can be solved

1. Sorting list of integers
2. Finding shortest path
3. Encrypt a message and deliver it to your friend
