Propositional Logic consists of 2 parts:

1. Proposition
2. [[Logic]]

**Proposition** is a declarative sentence (that is declaring a fact or stating an argument) that can be either True or False but cannot be both.

Propositions:
- Delhi is the capital of India
- 1 + 1 = 2

Not propositions:
- What time is it?
- x + 1 = 2

**Propositional Logic** is the area of logic that studies ways of joining and or or modifying propositions to form more complicated propositions. It also studies logical relationships and properties derived from these combined propositions.

Statement 1: Shyam is good at Math.
Statement 2: Shyam is bad at History.

"Shyam is good at Math but bad at History"

We're joining the 2 statements using logical connective "and"

Propositional logic is also called as "sentential logic" or "statement logic"

Combined propositions can also be called as **Combined Propositions**
