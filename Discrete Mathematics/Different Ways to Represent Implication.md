Truth table:

| p   | q   | p $\longrightarrow$ q |
| --- | --- | --------------------- |
| T   | T   | T                     |
| T   | F   | F                     |
| F   | T   | T                     |
| F   | F   | T                     |
Simple representations:

1. if p then q
2. p implies q
3. q when p
4. q whenever p
5. q follows from p

Complex representations:

1. p only if q
2. q is necessary for p
3. p is sufficient for q
4. q unless $\large \textlnot$p
## p only if q

"I'll stay at home only if I'm sick"

This is equivalent to "If I stay at home then I'm sick" that is if p then q

This is not equivalent to "If I'm sick then I will stay at home" that if q then p

If I'm not at home, that means p is False, in that case I may or may not be sick, that is q could be either True or False

But if I'm staying at home, I'm definitely sick, else p $\longrightarrow$ q is False

## q is necessary for p

*When A is necessary for B then falsity of A ensures the falsity of B but we cannot ensure the truth of B from the truth of A*

"Good food is necessary to keep us alive"
## p is sufficient for q

*When A is sufficient for B then, truth of A ensures the truth of B but falsity of A doesn't ensure the falsity of B*

"It is sufficient for you to travel by car in order to reach your destination on time"

p is **not necessary** for q
## q unless $\large \textlnot$p
