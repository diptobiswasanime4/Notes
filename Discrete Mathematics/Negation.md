Let p be a proposition.

Then $\large \textlnot$p is called negation of p which states that:

"It is not the case that p"

Example - "And then they lived happily ever after"

"It is not the case that then they lived happily ever after"

Also,

"Then they couldn't live happily ever after"

Negation is similar to [[NOT Gate]]
