Precedence of operators helps us to decide which operator will get evaluated first in a complicated looking compound proposition.

| Operators             | Names         | Precedence |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| $\large \lnot$        | Negation      | 1          |
| ^                     | Conjunction   | 2          |
| $\vee$                | Disjunction   | 3          |
| $\longrightarrow$     | Implication   | 4          |
| $\longleftrightarrow$ | Biconditional | 5          |
