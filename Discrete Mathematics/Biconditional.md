Let p and q be two propositions. The biconditional statement is called "p if and only if q" or in short "p iff q"

It is denoted by p $\longleftrightarrow$ q

p $\longleftrightarrow$ q is true whenever the values of p and q are same, that is either both are true or both are false

| p   | q   | p $\longleftrightarrow$ q |
| --- | --- | ------------------------- |
| T   | T   | T                         |
| T   | F   | F                         |
| F   | T   | F                         |
| F   | F   | T                         |
It is composed of two statements:

1. **p if q** i.e **if q then p**
2. **p only if q** i.e **if p then q**

(p $\longrightarrow$ q) ^ (q $\longrightarrow$ p) $\large \equiv$ p $\longleftrightarrow$ q

1. p is necessary and sufficient for q and vice versa
2. if p then q, and conversely
3. p iff q
