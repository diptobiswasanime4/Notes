**Tautology** is a compound proposition which is always TRUE

| p   | $\large \lnot$p | p $\vee$ $\large \lnot$p |
| --- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| T   | F               | T                        |
| F   | T               | T                        |

**Contradiction** is a compound proposition which is always FALSE

| p   | $\large \lnot$p | p ^ $\large \lnot$p |
| --- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| T   | F               | F                   |
| F   | T               | F                   |

**Contingency** is a compound proposition which is sometimes TRUE and sometimes FALSE

## Takeaways

1. Tautology is always satisfiable but satisfiable isn't always Tautology
## Summary

| Tautology   | Contradiction | Contingency     |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| always TRUE | always FALSE  | Both, Sometimes |
| Satisfiable | Unsatisfiable | Satisfiable     |
| Valid       | Invalid       | Invalid         |
