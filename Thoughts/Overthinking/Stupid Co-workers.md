One of or some of my co-workers are very stupid. They think things need to be in order, or should be approved by a higher authority to keep moving. Like transferring base locations.

They don't understand everything in office is a power game. You build leverages. And people with leverages, like me when I had an offer, often get unfair benefits. It's not unfair, but for stupid people this feels like unfair. And I will not tell it out loud that I got this benefit because of an offer. Please try to understand stupid.

Similarly I'm working from Kolkata by force. They may not like it. But they have come to accept it. So don't blow it on my face stupid, and keep quiet. There are atleast 2 people I know, who're so stupid to not understand something so basic, you have to understand because I cannot say it, atleast not say it so that you can understand, better you don't understand.

Forcing me to come back to Bangalore, the probability of this is very low, atleast this year, and I can drag it more. But I'm overthinking because of stupid questions of some.

And I have to give interviews outside to feel confident. Don't endlessly prepare. Also apply. Just do it and don't be lazy. And try to keep your ears shut for useless stupid, and open for intelligent info.

Sometimes I wonder how such stupid people live their lives. But they do. Maybe I should only get rid of the ego of being intelligent. There is nothing to be so proud of. But I should definitely reap the advantages of being intelligent.
