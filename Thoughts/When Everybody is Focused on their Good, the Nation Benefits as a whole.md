Communists claim that people work because of greed, and that can never benefit the society

Capitalists on the other hand claim, that greed is what drives people to work, and it is a good thing. Each individuals profit, sums up and profits the entire nation.

There is no doubt, since the collapse of the Soviet Union that the Capitalists are right in this.

But profits need to be ethical, that is something we must ensure.
