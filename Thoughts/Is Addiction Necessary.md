This is quite the controversial take. But in my opinion everybody is addicted to something! What is the addiction determines their life and future.

In general when we hear the term addiction we tend to correlate with something negative. And that is also the intention behind the title of this Blog. But what I intent to state is that we must identify our negative addictions. Yes, we have to identify first, we're often addicted to various things without our conscious knowledge.

After doing this, we have to get rid of the negative addiction. This is not so easy. Because addiction becomes part of who we are. We have to gradually replace it with positive addiction. This is the same when we talk about getting rid of negative habits and develop positive habits.

Unless we do this we'll forever be stuck in the rat-race!
