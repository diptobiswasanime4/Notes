"Don't say Hunger, show Hunger."

Hunger is the most essential ingredient of success, of any kind of success. Recently retired captain of Indian Football Team Sunil Chhetri also says the same.

When it comes to Indian Football, we're told that we don't have infrastructure, we don't have grassroots, all of that is true. But none of that is an excuse that our players don't have the hunger to win.

Lack of Grassroot development, and infrastructure cannot be blamed when we cannot win against teams in much worse situation than us. Also there is no money in Football is also a lie. Football is the 2nd most highly paid sports in India especially since the start of the ISL, although still at a large distance from cricket.

What is lacking is not really infrastructure or another excuse. Hunger is lacking among the entire Football ecosystem in India. It's not even an ecosystem, it's a Dog eat Dog world!
