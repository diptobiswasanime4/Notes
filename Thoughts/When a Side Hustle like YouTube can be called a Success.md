I run a YouTube channel called *The Normie Programmer*

I don't make any money out of it right now. Looking at the market situation, I'd say Rs. 50000-60000 a month can be called as successful i.e. 600-700$ per month

Apart from that, I also have my real job. Adding both, I'll have a good income, and passion, but a lot of hard work is required for that, it's not easy.

Ironically United Nations considers people earning less than 2$ a day i.e. less than 700$ a year are Below Poverty Line. So technically I'm poor only considering my YouTube income, thankfully I have my full-time job or another full-time commitment to complement that!

Big mistake above!

People earning less than 2$ a day or people earning less than 50-60$ a month or people earning less than 700$ a year are considered Below Poverty Line by the UN. I'm earning at least 10 times more than that. So I'm not poor by UN standard.

How can I earn so much money being so klutzy!?
