Right now there is ISL and I-League

ISL has 13 Teams and I-League has 45 Teams (adding all 3 divisions)

We need 16 Teams in ISL. And 8 more Teams in ISL, totaling 53, and we can combine 3 divisions into 1.

Each Team in ISL can play 3 matches against each opponent, 45 matches a season.

Each Team in I-League can play 1 match against each opponent, 52 matches a season.

Then we can have Regional, State-level, District-level and Ground-level Divisions.

We can have 3 Divisions nationally, and 6 Divisions in State, equaling 9 divisions for the country which is more than enough to win the FIFA World Cup.
