Nara Chandrababu Naidu is the best example of how you can serve the country, being the Chief Minister of a State. Naveen Patnaik could be another example.
## Case 1

**NCBN stays in Power till 2034, state is divided.**

This is the best case for India! For Telegus, I don't know. Maybe I know, but I won't say much.

NCBN governs united Andhra Pradesh for 2 decades, then divided Andhra Pradesh for 2 decades.

Hyderabad becomes one of the top IT cities of India, but much much better than what we have now. Bangalore will face tough competition and hence improve more, S. M. Krishna may get an extension.

Andhra Pradesh is divided and NCBN governs divided Andhra Pradesh for 2 decades more.

Amaravati becomes the top city of India, and one of the top cities of the World, again if not the top. We cannot even comprehend what we missed.

All of Indians will prosper, but Telegus a bit more than others (even more than Gujaratis)

After him his legacy continues.

## Case 2

**NCBN stays in Power till 2034, state is united.**

NCBN governs for almost 4 decades. Hyderabad becomes the top IT city in India (not one of the top)

Rest of Andhra Pradesh prospers.

Telegus and Andhra Pradesh become the richest state in India for this century (even ahead of Gujarat)

After him his legacy continues.

## Case 3

**NCBN stays in Power till 2029, state is united.**

NCBN governs for 34 years. The outcome is not very different from Case 2.

He will be compared with the Commies of West Bengal because of their equal length of tenure, only to show that the Commies were and are dumb.

## Default Case

**This is what we have currently.**

There is no doubt that NCBN's legacy continues (Hyderabad is one of the top IT cities in India) and will continue (Amaravati will be better than Hyderabad no doubt)

But he could've done more, but we haven't allowed him to do more!
