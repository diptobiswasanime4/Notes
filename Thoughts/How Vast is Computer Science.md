Computer Science as a study is so vast that I cannot learn everything even in 1000 years, or in 20 lifetimes, assuming I work 50 years dedicatedly with Computer Science in each lifetime. But I'd love doing so!

Rather this is only the lower-end.

In fact I can barely scratch the surface of Computer Science in 100 or even in 1000 lifetimes, being fully devoted to the subject for whole life, for 100+ years in each lifetime.

Computer Science is a subject of brilliant minds. It humbles people down! Years of experience, multi-line Degrees, multi-page resume doesn't matter. Only things that matter is love, passion, hard work, and God's grace.

A 15 year old kid could be a Computer Science genius, compared to a 65 year old guy. But Computer Science for her richness needs and wants both of them, the spark and the strength, the flame and the resilience.
