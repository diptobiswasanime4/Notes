Computer Science is so vast that I cannot learn everything even in 1000 years, or in 20 lifetimes, assuming I work 50 years dedicatedly with Computer Science in each lifetime. But I'd love doing so!

Rather this is the lower-end.

In fact I can barely scratch the surface of Computer Science even in 100 or 1000 lifetimes, being fully devoted for 100+ years in each lifetime.
