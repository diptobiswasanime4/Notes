Human beings are living for a while on Earth, and since then we've had Social, Behavioral and many other kinds of Evolution. And before becoming Human beings from Monkeys we had Biological evolution. It is also worth noting that we required different sorts of skills at different stages of our evolutionary journey.

I will start the process more than 100-thousand years ago, when Human beings became like we're today after the Cognitive Revolution (we were still living in the Stone-Age although). Raw Intelligence became the single-largest determining factor of our survival in that era.

I believe we can go even further back. We know that Lucy, the oldest Ape-Human fossil discovered is more than 2-million years old. So let's consider more than 2-million years back, we're very much on our journey to become Human Beings, Cognitively.

So for the 1st 2-million years since then, we were not very smart. We're not even fully human but on our way to becoming so. So how did we act? And what was the biggest factor in our survival? It's very hard to predict. But we can guess.

Let's call this age, the Pre-Stone age, that spanned for 2-million years. And Physical Strength is the single biggest factor. We were not very intelligent, but still quite intelligent compared to other animals. We were definitely not at the top of the food-chain. But we could manage ourselves. It is also very much possible that core human sexual behavior has developed in this age. Since Physical Strength is the most important factor of survival, this is also the most important quality women sees in men, even in the Modern Age, subconsciously, although this is not very important right now.

Then we come to the Stone-Age, and we have become has IQ as Modern Human beings. But we don't have the Knowledge and Technology as them. We have to build everything from scratch. Raw Intelligence becomes the biggest factor of survival. Physical Strength becomes secondary but still important. We start creating stone-tools, sharpening them, and Hunting Mammoths. We will live 50-thousand years like this. And we're still not at the top of the food-chain, but much much better than before. Sexual Behavior also evolves. An intelligent flavor is added to the Dominance established in the Pre-Stone Age

Let's formally name the 5 Ages as:

1. Age of Strength or Pre-Stone Age (around 2 million years)
2. Age of Intelligence or Stone-Age (around 50 thousand years till 15000 BCE-ish)
3. Age of Tradition or Age of Culture or Age of Agriculture (around 10 thousand years, 15000-5000 BCE-ish)
4. Age of Philosophy or Age of Civilization (5000 BCE-ish to 2000 AD)
5. Age of Leisure or Age of Tech or Digital Age (1000 years, 2000-3000 AD, could be more)
