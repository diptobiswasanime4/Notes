"India never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity"

Only if Nara Chandrababu Naidu had won the 2019 State Assembly elections, we'd be getting a truly world-class Global city. But the opportunity is now lost. Amaravati is a lost opportunity.

We have all seen Hyderabad. You can also say Cyberabad. CBN built Hyderabad in 8 years. Then other Chief Ministers followed. But it was his Brainchild.

He planned to build Amaravati in 15 years. Double the time. Because the city is many times better. Then later CMs would follow. We must remember, nothing great ever happens with "fits and starts"

Now Amaravati will be built. But it will be like another Bangalore or Hyderabad, maybe marginally better.

We have all seen Hyderabad. You can also say Cyberabad. CBN built Hyderabad in 8-9 years. Then other Chief Ministers followed. But it was his Brainchild.

He planned to build Amaravati in 15-20 years. More than double the time. Because the city is many many times better, one of the best cities of the World if not the best. Then later CMs would follow. We must remember, nothing great ever happens with "fits and starts"
