Western Systems are very rigid. It's all about numbers, and logic, and execution.

But reality is very different. People dislike rigid systems. Often rigid systems doesn't work.

The World is complex. Hence we need to develop Fluid Systems.

Western Culture won't allow the development of such systems. The best they can do is Wokeism. Which is arguably another rigid system. Break the ruling system with the help of a militant rebel system.

Indian Culture is suitable for the development of a Fluid System. This will ensure smooth World governance for the next 1000 years. Smooth doesn't necessarily mean good, it means appropriate.

But first, we shouldn't be so surprised when things doesn't go as per plan. It's part of the Fluid System.
