Visible Poverty is Poverty that you can see with your eyes. This is not Poverty that you see already being eradicated in fancy Statistics.

So how to end it ? How much money do you need ?

Visible Poverty can be eradicated with very low amount of money 250-300$ per capita, that we already had 30 years ago.

But money often isn't enough. Because people are poor not only because of the lack of money, they also lack lot of privileges that money provides, for example Education, Connections, Awareness, etc. They are stuck in multi-dimensional Poverty, pulling people out of it is very Complex, but possible, thankfully we have only 10% people in multi-dimensional poverty right now! They can also be called poor in Human Resource, although this is not an official terminology.

So to rephrase, if people are in poverty only because of the lack of money. Then we can end visible Poverty only with 250-300$ per capita per anum

But we're in a Complex situation.

To give example of another country, USA also has visible poverty. But their per capita GDP is 75000$+ 30 times more than what we need

And it seems that Visible Poverty is increasing in the US. 10 years ago there were no visible homeless people in SF, but now there are a hella lot!

So intent must be there. Otherwise Visible Poverty may still exist if per capita GDP is 100 or 200 times more.

It looks like money is an illusion, what poor people are lacking is something else!
