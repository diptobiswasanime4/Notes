[[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)]] causes difficulty in focusing, especially in uninteresting activities.

In case of very interesting activities although, the person with [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)|ADHD]] can hyper-focus. So it's like a double-edged sword.

So Do I have ADHD ?

I never went to the Doctor regarding this. But I believe I do.
