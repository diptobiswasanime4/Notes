I always wonder how people have Control, Delusion & Stupidity, because they're dangerous.

Control is dangerous because it is an impulse from the Limbic system. We seek to control something. But in the Digital Age, the opposite seems to happen.

Delusion is the false sense of achievement. It can also be a false sense of failure. But most trouble comes from the former rather than later.

And Stupidity, we all know, is just being stupid! Sometimes I wonder, all human beings came from the same ancestor, how can some humans be so stupid. It is a game of probability or we're the ones who're judging are actually stupid.

One thing about stupidity is that, it's not that bad. Rather being intelligent could be bad. You can't relate to anybody. Sometimes we wish to be stupid and happy!
