As little children we make demands to our parents, and our parents happily fulfill our demands. There's nothing wrong in it, rather everything is right.

But as we start growing up, our demands keep on increasing, as well as become more and more complex. It is no longer possible for our parents to fulfill those demands anymore, even if they want to.

So we have to take responsibility to fulfill our own demands. But we don't want to. Because deep-inside we're still a child. We haven't grown up.

We have to understand that when we grow up, our work is our primary identity.

So Swami Ji gives 7 responsibilities that we should take:

1. Fulfilling my demands is my responsibility
2. Quality of work is my responsibility
3. Effective communication is my responsibility
4. My behavior is my responsibility
5. How I spend my time is my responsibility
6. My values & principles is my responsibility
7. I have to make myself happy, it is my responsibility
