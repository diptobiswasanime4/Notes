Indian Economy has a lot of challenges as well as opportunities.

But one thing, that is not often mentioned is that the Indian Economy also carries a lot of burdens, from the 1000-year Colonial Rule. Hence other Economies at a similar state often appears to be and is much better performing, e.g. could be winning proportionally a lot more Olympic medals.

Per Capita:

250-300$ - 30 years ago
500$ - 25 years ago
1000$ - 15 years ago
1500$ - 10 years ago
2000$ - 5 years ago
2500$ - Now
3000$ - 2025-2026, also when reaching the total Economy of 5-trillion $
4000$ - By end of this decade, about to become an early stage Upper-Middle-Income-Economy
5000-6000$ - By early next decade, an Upper-Middle-Income-Economy

We will start to see sea-changes in the Indian Society only when India becomes an Upper-Middle-Income-Economy, i.e. when our per capita GDP becomes in the 4000-5000$ range. Visible poverty will become non-existent, which unfortunately still exists almost everywhere although visibly reducing.

Had it not been for the 1000-year Colonial burden, we could end visible poverty at the current state of the Indian Economy, it's possible, but we have to wait for a while, for half-a-decade.

Our job as Citizens is to work hard, Grow our Money, and Grow the Economy.

## Poverty & Visible Poverty

The current Govt. Modi 3.0 who is doing a Great work according to me claims that they have ended poverty. This could be true, but they have not ended visible poverty.

Why I'm emphasizing more on Visible Poverty rather than Poverty is because it's the absolute worst. We must end it at all cost.

Poverty means when people are poor. Visible Poverty means when people look poor. Why do they look poor, if they're not poor? It shows a poverty of mindset, of the people, as well as of the Big shots.

By 2030 we should be having lesser, rather much much lesser visible poverty, than the "Rich" Western World and their "Boss" the United States.

By early next decade, Visible Poverty in India must come to an absolute end! The same could've been done 30 years ago, but no more wasting time. This is a war on Poverty! Only when visible Poverty is eradicated we can claim the eradication of poverty, and not only cite Statistics.

## When will India become a Rich Economy ?

We have a demographic dividend for the next 30+ years. We must reap the benefits of this demographic advantage and become rich before getting old. Hence at any cost, India that is Bharat, must become a Rich Economy by 2050, max. till 2060. Otherwise, the wheels will start rotating backwards, we'll once again become poor, and may remain so forever.

To reiterate, in the next 30 years, India must become a Rich Economy, i.e. by 2050, max. by 2060, no further late.

## What can a Common Man (and Woman) do in this ?

A Common Man must think of how to grow his income by legal means of course. Because every common man's income contributes to the GDP.

A common man can think of quadrupling his income in the next 4-5 years. In case of me it is earning Rs. 45 lac+ per anum by 2029, if not sooner.
