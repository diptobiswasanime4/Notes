I have only 2 passion in life:

1. Hindutva
2. Computer Science

They are not in any order. Both are of equal importance.

Visible Poverty will end in India by early next decade.

India will become a Rich Economy by 2050-60

This will become possible because of Computer Science & Hindutva. Other fields are also important, but not as much as these 2.

Hindutva & Computer Science will give a new vision to the whole World
