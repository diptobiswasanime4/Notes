NCBN planned to make a Greenfield city, Amaravati the new capital of the newly formed State. Amaravati would've been a smart world-class and truly Global city. But he lost elections in 2019 and the plan was foiled. Amaravati will still be built but it will only be like another Bangalore or Hyderabad (maybe marginally better)

So what if he won the 2019 elections?

He'd get 3-4 terms i.e. 15-20 years to build Amaravati. Double the time he got to build Hyderabad.

In that case, Andhra Pradesh will overtake Gujarat and start to lead India by 2047 till at least 2100

Amaravati would've been our pride, the best Megacity in India if not the world.

But "India never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity"
