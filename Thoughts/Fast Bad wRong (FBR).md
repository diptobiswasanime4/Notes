FBR is a framework for productivity, where it is advised to get started with a new project:

1. As fast as possible
2. You don't care how bad it is
3. There is also no need for it to be right

Sounds strange.

But that's where the magic lies.

In the FBR framework you rid yourself of all expectations, and hence allow [[Creativity|creativity]] to flow through you. In the process, you'll get many more ideas. Execute them again with the FBR framework.

The results are very rewarding.
