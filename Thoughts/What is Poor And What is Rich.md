25 years ago, per capita GDP of India was around 500$ Now it is 2500$ So we have gotten rich. But we want to grow richer.

So what really is rich? And what is poor?

2500-3000$ feels rich. 400-500$ feels poor. Because we have seen both. But rich and poor is more about perception rather than the money count.

Somebody who doesn't have a house, wants to build a house. So they need more money. But who already has a house, they can live off comfortably with 400-500$ (with Govt. subsidized prices of necessary commodities, sometimes sharing resources among the Community which is not directly counted within GDP)

So one of the big issues that we can point out behind the visible poverty in India is the loot of land of the people of India during the Mughal and the British era, and nothing smart being done in the Congress era (although efforts were made by certain local govts. to give back people their land, e.g. West Bengal)

So what happened in the last 1000 years of Colonial rule has an undeniably big impact, still!

If the Colonial rule didn't happen, I'm sure the people of the country would be happy even with 400-500$ per capita income, because all essential needs have already been taken care of, and the people of India are generally not greedy because of the Culture of this land, unlike other Cultures. What is considered poor today, would be considered comfortable, at different circumstances. And the present per capita GDP may actually have lesser value, hence considered poor, when compared with the hypothetical scenario.

Hence the real question is, when will our people become comfortable in the present circumstances? I would reframe the question, when will visible poverty disappear from our country, at what per capita GDP? I don't have a definite answer. But I estimate, that by 2030, our per capita GDP will become 4000-5000$ and visible poverty will end.

Now compare. If we have no Colonial Rule, have our land, and many other things intact, the kind of life that we can get at 400-500$ per capita GDP we'll be getting now at 4000-5000$ per capita GDP. We need 10 times to rebuild things that we have lost! Now this is a rough estimate.

But we're getting one thing extra. That is the fire, the drive to grow rich and conquer. We may want to grow 10 times again to 40000-50000$ and conquer to world!
