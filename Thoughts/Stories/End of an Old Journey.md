There were 4 guards, one of them is Mitch, and Dane, all walking through the forest. The guards had torches. They were escorting him outside. The forest didn't look as scary in the presence of company.

"So Dane, I heard you and Shane grew up together, you were such good friends. So why did Shane all of a sudden kick you out? Looks odd to me", Mitch asked Dane.

"Same idea", Dane sighed. "I have no idea Mitch, what wrong did I do? Do you have any idea?"

"Me?", Mitch laughed. "What a funny question? How do I know what's happening between the two of you?"

"Even I don't know. So I'm asking you. You may have some idea. Being in charge of the Military. Or have some hunch or intuition if nothing else."

"You're saying puny guards like us, the Military", Mitch laughed hard. The other guards were stoic. "You're funny man! I have no idea."

"Oh that's too bad."

"But if you talk about intuition. Checka's sister is really good at this. I didn't know you were such good friends. You have a great talent of making good friends everywhere I must tell you."

"Thanks a lot. But she didn't say anything. She only gave me a blank piece of paper."

"She's actually very popular. A lot of puny people went to her to read their fortune. And whatever she says is mostly right. Lot of my friends in the guards also knows her. She reads fortune for minimal cost, and sometimes for free, but she's moody, she doesn't read often, and sometimes she gives a blank paper."

"That's what she did."

"Because she says she doesn't want to become popular, especially among the higher ups. She's happy being a peasant."

"I'd dispute that in the past. But now I agree", Dane said.

"I'd always agree. The higher ups are scum!", Mitch said.

"... ..."

"Don't worry man! You're no longer a higher up. You're now a peasant, so you're good", Mitch laughed.

Dane also laughed.

"But one thing I will tell you."

"... ..."

"It's not intelligence or intuition. It's only my opinion..."

"No worries. I'll take it with a pinch of salt."

"You stole the words out of my mouth."

"LOL"
