Mitch shook hands with Dane. Both smiled. Mitch was about to cry. But he didn't. Dane was more stoic. Not like the rest of the guards of course. They didn't say a word. Then one of them said, "Dane, I wish you goodluck on your new journey!"

"You may not know us, but we heard a lot about you. Goodluck", the other guards followed.

"Thanks a lot to you too for escorting me outside. Also for securing the Castle all these years when I was living", Dane replied with a smile.

"Dane, where will you go? Do you have a place? Do you have some plans", Mitch asked.

"Not really. The Castle was all I had. I have to think what I can do now."

"... ..."

"Maybe I have to rediscover myself", Dane laughed.

"Even I cannot suggest anything", Mitch said with grief.

"You don't have to. Thanks for all that you have done. I'll find my way", Dane said. And left.

Mitch and the guards saw Dane going away and vanishing in the dark.

Mitch released a deep breadth. He turned towards one of the guards. "Hey Gigi, now even I'm wondering."

"What?"

"Dane grew up with Shane and the Duke. And now he says that he has nothing outside the Castle, and he's a nobody."

"... ..."

"Even I'm like that. My friends & family, everything has something to do with the Castle. And unlike him I'm not even a noble. I'm a peasant."

"We all are same."

"So what will happen if someday I'm also kicked out of the Castle. If he can be, any of us can be. It's all a Game of luck."

"I disagree. Dane should have killed the Duke and banished Shane, then taken over the Castle when the time was right. It's not only poor luck. It's also poor decision", Gigi said.

"... ...", Mitch was silent.

"But people make poor decisions. It's necessary to learn how to take good decisions, and the only way is by taking bad decisions, so I don't see what happened purely as negative, there is also some positive lessons."

The World is a dangerous place. Everywhere is dangerous, everything is dangerous. everybody is danger. This is what Dane is thinking.
