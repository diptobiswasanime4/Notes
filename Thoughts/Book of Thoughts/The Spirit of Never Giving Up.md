Warriors never give up.

Every man is a warrior. There are many difficulties in life. But it is the duty of the man to cruise through every difficulty without letting the difficulty affect his mind.

But Frankly speaking most men fail to do so. They give in to the difficulty. They give up. They submit.

But why!?

Because it is difficult. Very very difficult.

So it is their fault. They are not man enough.

Yes and no!

Purely from a material point of view, yes! But we should also have empathy, so no.

We must understand that our world is not a zero-sum-game. Nor is it winner take it all.

Because we tend to have less difficulty, when we have everything. Suddenly we're very manly. Everything is more difficult when we have nothing. Then we're not man enough.

So isn't it purely a game of haves and have-nots!?

More importantly today's haves could be tomorrow's have-nots, and vice versa.

So I believe a better strategy for both parties is avoid anything extreme. Don't insult who doesn't have anything, try to help him, tomorrow that could be you. Respect who has something, and don't brand them as oppressor, again tomorrow that could be you.

We should be more realistic about the realities and show empathy.

Also in the face of difficulties we should develop the spirit of the warrior. If we fail, no worries! Get back up and try again tomorrow. Keep going, keep going and never give up.
