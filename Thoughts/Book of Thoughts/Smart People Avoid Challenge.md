Being smart is more psychological than real. From childhood, some kids are told they're smart. Maybe they're good at basic calculations. Eventually everybody becomes good at basic calculations. And when we grow up, it matters more to get the job done, than being smart.

Smart kids struggle when they grow up. Because when they were young, everything was goody-goody and simple math problems, that no one else could solve. It makes them feel good. And they started doing more and more of the same stuff, and avoid other low IQ stuff, rather what is perceived to be low IQ. Social interactions could be one of them.

When they grow up. The situation is flipped. Suddenly Social interactions are more desirable than solving Math problems. In your job, what is more important, doing the job, or effectively communicating about it. Yes it's doing the job. But communication is more fun. Hence we have some roles that does the job, and some roles that communicate. Everything starts and ends at human behavior.

Hence what we need to know is that, feeling stupid is very important. It makes us explore and do difficult things. We cannot be smart all the time. We're not all knowing Gods or anything like that.

Doing stupid things also increases humility. We understand that stupid things are really not stupid, we think they're stupid, but actually we're the ones that're stupid!
