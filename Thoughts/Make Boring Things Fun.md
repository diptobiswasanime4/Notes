The mind in the 21st century has an infinite amount of stimulation. It is doubtful if ever in the past we were so overstimulated.

But the worry is that among all kinds of stimulation, the brain is always drawn towards the more and more intense kinds of overstimulation. There are many, but Pornography is a good example of this.

More and more we stimulate ourselves, we become numb to the same kind of stimulation in the future. We look for more intensity. And giving in to what the brain wants will lead to death! Because it's sure-shot addiction. And we have an experiment on addicted rats that everybody knows thanks to YouTube. An addicted rat prefers death by repeatedly pressing a pleasure button, instead of searching for food!

The only way to get out of this predicament is making boring things fun.
