We're often puzzled by too many choices. We want to do many things but end up doing nothing. We love to plan. Because there is perfection in planning. And who doesn't like perfection, especially chronic procrastinators. So we plan, plan, plan, and do nothing.

What we should realize is that, imperfection is better than perfection. Controlling the mind to do what you have in hand is more important and fulfilling, rather than planning to do 100 perfect things.

But why do we hate imperfection? I'm not so sure of that. Maybe it's another Stone Age habit. If you're not perfectly prepared, you'll be hunted instead of hunting. We were not at the top of the Food Chain back then, and we lived like that for 100 thousand years, for most of our existence. So it's natural it affects our psyche.

Then there's another thing called regret. We could've done something better but we didn't. We didn't even do average. We did the worst. So now I have to repent and hence I will end up doing nothing once again. All of these regrets will accumulate at our old age and we'll hope for the best for the afterlife. Such desires will then shape our next life, and who knows how many more lives after that, as we know from many schools of Indian Philosophy.

If we simply do what we have in hand, the result will be miraculous, still imperfect, but better than any perfect plan. We need to realize this. And work towards our goals everyday. We don't need to plan them anymore!
