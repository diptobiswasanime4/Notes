Although once considered backward, Odisha has the potential to become the 2nd leading State in India by 2100 (next to Gujarat)

The main reason behind is good governance and political stability for the whole Century.

Naveen Patnaik governed the State for the 1st Q of this Century. The remaining 3 Qs will be governed by BJP. The change in power happened so smoothly, it didn't even feel like a change.
