Many people wonder about does the Universe give signals to several people. There is no definite answer to this, but its true that people feel special about themselves if they get such "signals"

I always thought that it's really nothing but a false sense of self-importance, and the Universe has no business giving signals to millions of people. None of us is Sargon of Akkad!

But few things happened recently, that made me rethink my assumption.

I came to know about a place.

![[Socotra island.png]]

Initially I thought that it is an Alien planet, must be from some Sci-Fi movie.

But its not. It's Socotra island, close to the Horn of Africa

It's not even an uninhabited island, close to 50000 people live there.

Then I came to know about a person, from a Ted talk.

![[Sam Berns.png]]

Initially I thought this must be a robot. But then I learnt that this guy is Sam Berns.

He died early of a rare disease called Progeria, that causes early and accelerated ageing.

So its really a lack of my knowledge, and no such signal from the Universe right?

Right! But it also means that "Truth is Stanger than Fiction"

The Universe reveals the Strange aspects of Truth to us at a special time. Now I truly believe that is a signal from the Universe.
