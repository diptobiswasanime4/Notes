Concentration is no doubt the World's biggest currency in the 21st century. It can single-handedly make or break a person's career, hence the person, himself or herself.

Swami Vivekananda gives a very simple suggestion to develop concentration, "Do whatever you're doing with the fullest attention."

Sounds very simple, but actually doing it unbelievably difficult! But whoever can do it will get all the rewards human-life has to offer.
