30+ years ago, the per capita GDP of our country was only 200-250$ Why am I saying only? Because it's considered too low and poor. And why is it considered so? Because it looks so.

So what if we change the looks with the same wealth? Would it still be considered poor? No I guess.

This is called visible poverty. What looks poor.

What people need is not really money. They need privileges. Facilities to use a softer word. They are fixated on money because money is the means to get resources.

USA is getting richer and richer, and the number of homeless people is also getting higher and higher. Compared to 200-250$ per capita income, they're already at 30-40 times, soon they could be at 50 times, and then at 100 times, but the current trend of increasing homelessness and drug addiction, all of the signs of Visible Poverty are only getting higher and higher. So who is reaping all the benefits of the increase in GDP, the top of the Pyramid.

Even 30+ years ago India didn't suffer a homelessness crisis, or a drug addiction crisis. So what is poor and what is rich?

One thing is certain. It's about the management of resources. If human beings are provided with their basic needs, that they already produce (not in case of India, where there is multi-dimensional poverty, but I'm talking in general) money is not really important.

And if money is not important, there is low corruption, low foreign interference, high nationalism, all goody-goody stuff.

Specifically for India, since we're suffering from multi-dimensional poverty although reducing, it is necessary that we grow our GDP to at least 50000-60000$ per capita per anum in the next 30+ years reaping benefits of our demographic dividend, at least 20 times of the minimum money that is required. This is also make us equivalent with other members of the G7 apart from the "big boss" US maybe even ahead of some countries like Japan and Italy extrapolating on their current standings (which may not be true then, but can be regarded as an educated assumption)

With the right intent, Visible Poverty can be eradicated even with 100$ per capita income, considering Poverty is only due to lack of wealth!

And with the lack of intent, Visible Poverty exists even with 1000000$ per capita income (1 million)

Big mistake!

There is a problem of factor, it is hence increased by 10 times!
